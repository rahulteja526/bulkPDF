# bulkPDF
## This repo is useful for bulk DOCX/PDF creation from CSV data rows

Hi,

This repo can help you in creating PDF/DOC files using the data values from a CSV or XLSX files.

This file is created with inspiration from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbPV4ccOZ8k 

Instructions:

1. Clone the Repository.
2. Create Virtualenv (it is optional, but, a better approach).
3. Create two folders inside the repository, "Doc" and "PDF" (Due to GIT rules, I can not keep empty folders :( ).
4. Install the packages using the 'requirements.txt' (use "pip install -r requirements.txt", if you are using a virtual environment).
5. run the createBulk.py file.
6. See the magic in the folders "Doc" and "PDF".
